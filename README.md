# Eagle Ride Sharing Platform
A simple and easily deployable ride sharing webapp using Django.
## Inspiration
Students face one challenge daily and that is to get to their classes on time from their dorms or apartments and especially international students find it difficult  to buy  a car in the first few semesters and to be able to go from dorms and apartments to nearby places and around university on less cost is a challenge .Even though universities provide a few campus shuttles and few other options for transport, we believe that more could be done on this .Especially every university has some local students who have cars and usually they travel alone, so with  a ride sharing web application it could be useful and more energy efficient and more environment friendly if carpooling was done.
## What it does
Eagle ride sharing application provides a web application and each university could even make it authorized for only its students so that students could carpool , and without worrying about paying for other ride sharing apps like lyft and uber.Students also would feel more safer as they know that they would drive with other students of the university. It would also serve as a more efficient way of networking and making friends.The driver student could post that there is a ride available to a specified location and the other students could view it and could message them under a secure and safe environment and do efficient carpooling that could save their money and time and the driver could feel that he did a good service for the environment and as well as they could get a chance of making new friends and networking.Google maps could also be integrated to show the distances of the rides available.A common meeting point could be located in the university like the parking lot , where they could hop in onto the ride needed.

## How we built it
We built it using Django webframework.

## Challenges we ran into
We found it difficult at this stage to integrate the sso from university as authorizations were needed, but we could easily do it in the future .
